# Gamehub 2

## Description

Built using full MERN Stack development, Gamehub is a mock online gaming store. You can browse different games, **"buy"** the ones you want, or add a game to the platform. Create an account as a `gamer` to see all the game selections and purchase the ones that interest you, or create a `developer` account to add your own games.
